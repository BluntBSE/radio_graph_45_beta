The Transformation Pipeline
This is doing 3 consecutive transformations:

1. Local to World Space
VERTEX is the vertex position in local object space (relative to the mesh center)
Adding 1.0 as the 4th component creates a homogeneous coordinate (x, y, z, w)
The w=1.0 means this is a position (not a direction vector which would have w=0)
2. World to Camera Space
MODELVIEW_MATRIX combines:
Model Matrix: Transforms from object space to world space (object's position, rotation, scale)
View Matrix: Transforms from world space to camera space (camera's position, rotation)
This gives us the vertex position relative to the camera
3. Camera to Screen Space
PROJECTION_MATRIX handles:
Perspective projection: Makes distant objects smaller
Field of view: How wide the camera sees
Near/far clipping: What depth range is visible
Viewport mapping: Converts to normalized device coordinates [-1,1]
Why This Specific Order?
The matrices must be applied right-to-left because matrix multiplication isn't commutative:

VERTEX → Object space coordinates
MODEL → World space coordinates
VIEW → Camera space coordinates
PROJECTION → Screen space coordinates
In Your Volume Shader Context
For your volume rendering, this line is positioning each vertex of the cube mesh that represents the volume bounds. The cube vertices get transformed so that:
